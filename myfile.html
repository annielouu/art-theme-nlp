        Art reflects society, politics, culture, and personal experiences. The advancements in machine learning techniques offered us more powerful and structured ways to explore art history.    
        In this project, I used machine learning and Natural Language Processing to analyze the evolution of themes in art across history – from 3050 BCE to 2023 CE. 
        The project explores three approaches:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>I analyzed word frequency trends in artwork titles.</li>
        <li>I used BERTopic to conduct topic modeling on artwork titles.</li>
        <li>I used dimensionality reduction techniques on word embeddings and performed clustering.</li>
    </ol>
